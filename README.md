# Lakers

LakersShooting.py:

Read in Lakers individual per game and shooting data from 2021/22 season, removed players with few games played. Downloaded player headshots from Bball-Ref and added paths for Python to point to for logo plotting. Defined "getImage" function that pulls each of the images before the plot is created.

Plot shows mid-range shooting percentages against the percent of shots a player takes that are mid-range, using headshots for the data points.

Final for loop adds the images onto the data points that were pulled from the getImage fn.

Data used is lakersPerGame.csv and lakersShooting.csv.
